This File is edited first time.

Editor Used : Vim
Device Used : Realme C25s Android Smartphone
App Used : Termux

How : 

I used termux app to run Kali Linux on it. Only CLI interface of Kali is being used by me.

I created a repository on Github website.(Used Google Chrome in Incognito Mode to create repository on github web {Desktop view mode}).

I then used git inside Kali Linux to access commands and github, edited this file.

What's next : I am going to push these changes to a new branch, named First branch, on this repo at github.
and going to show changes made by me through CLI getting reflected on Github web interface.
